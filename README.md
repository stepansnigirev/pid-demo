# pid-demo

Demo page and article explaining PID control. In development.

Article is divided into several parts:

-Ideal PID controller
	- Basics of PID control: what P, I and D do and what happens if they are wrong or missing
	- Autotuning algorithms. Step responce, Relay method.
	- Ramping. How to ramp smart.
- Real PID controller
	- Working with limitations in output
	- Noisy measurements: filtering the data (Kalman filter)
	- Autotuning with noize
